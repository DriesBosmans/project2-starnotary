Hi there, thank you for reviewing my project.

Token name: Nottystar
Token symbol: NS
Address on the Rinkeby network: 0x225b22Ab35Db7dbba8599A761A0470807f13174E

1 thing I didn't understand was how I should compare the name and symbol in the first
unit test. We have a Name and symbol for the token, but the struct Star has a name aswell.
The name and symbol of this token are hardcoded, but the stars name can be picked.

Here are the instruction to set up the project:
